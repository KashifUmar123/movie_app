# The Movie App
This mobile app, developed in Flutter, showcases my skills by presenting upcoming movies with brief details. It utilizes the TMDB API service (https://developer.themoviedb.org/) for fetching movie information.

### Services used in the app:
- Firebase Remote Config: For remote configurations.
- Env Service: Used for managing environment variables.
- Get Storage: Used for shared preferences.
- Firebase Crashlytics: To monitor crashes and warnings in production.
- Dio with Interceptors: For making remote API calls.
- Alice Inspector: Used to inspect HTTP calls.

In this app, I have leveraged GetX for various purposes, including dependency injection, state management, and routing.
